In latex files it is possible to join many files using \inlcude{path} command. Write a program, which will calculate statistics concerning:
- number of used files
- number of typed words
- number of typed sentences
- number of paragraphs (in latex two or more consecutive end of lines in file correspond to a new paragraph)
- the program should not count statistics in comment region. The comment starts after % symbol and finishes with the end of line.
- the program should also omit text inside commands:
\begin{any letter}
here you may find almost all possible signs.
\end{any letter}

- the program should not print out anything, except the statistics after processing all files.
